Architecture
============
In the design, time to market was prioritized.

I used a non-relational database (MongoDB) in the cloud in Atlas

I use eve as a framework (https://docs.python-eve.org/en/stable/)

The development runs on GCP, in cloud run and the pipeline is solved with cloudbuild

User authentication is done with Basic Auth.
